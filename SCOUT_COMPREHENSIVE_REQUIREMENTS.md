### üîç Advanced Validation Systems

#### **Assertion-Level Validation Architecture:**

##### **1. Factual Assertion Validation:**
```typescript
Process:
1. Extract factual claims from legal assertion
2. Search case record for supporting evidence
3. Use NLP to assess evidence-claim alignment
4. Generate confidence scores and explanations

Example:
Assertion: "Plaintiff was driving 65 mph at the time of impact"
Validation: Cross-reference against:
- Police report (witness statements)
- Expert testimony (accident reconstruction)
- Deposition testimony (party admissions)
Result: "Strong support from Officer Smith's report (p. 15)"
```

##### **2. Legal Assertion Validation:**
```typescript
Process:
1. Extract legal claims and cited authorities
2. Retrieve full text of cited cases/statutes
3. Analyze if authorities actually support claim
4. Assess precedential weight and binding status

Example:
Assertion: "Contracts may be voided for mutual mistake"
Citation: "Sherwood v. Walker, 66 Mich. 568 (1887)"
Validation: 
- Retrieve case text from CourtListener
- Confirm case holding matches assertion
- Check subsequent treatment/overruling
Result: "Correctly states holding, but note Lenawee County limits application"
```

##### **3. Quotation Verification:**
```typescript
Process:
1. Extract quoted material from brief
2. Retrieve source text from CourtListener/ATTICUS
3. Find exact or semantic matches
4. Flag misquotations or context changes

Example:
Quote: "The right to privacy is fundamental"
Citation: "Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479 (1965)"
Verification: Check against Supreme Court database
Result: "Paraphrase accurate, actual quote: 'right of privacy is a fundamental personal right'"
```
