interface CitationExtractionAPI {
  extractCitations(text: string, options?: ExtractionOptions): Citation[];
  validateCitation(citation: string, style: 'bluebook' | 'alwd'): ValidationResult;
  formatCitation(citation: ParsedCitation, style: string): string;
  resolveIdCitation(idText: string, context: DocumentContext): IdResolution;
}

// Example: Document viewer API contract  
interface DocumentViewerAPI {
  loadDocument(filePath: string): Promise<Document>;
  navigateToPage(pageNumber: number): void;
  highlightText(range: TextRange, style: HighlightStyle): void;

- **Fallback**: Component-level optimization and caching strategies

**Security Vulnerabilities:**
- **Mitigation**: Security team reviews all inter-component communication
- **Fallback**: Security-first architecture with defense in depth

### 📅 **Schedule Risks**

**Team Dependencies:**
- **Mitigation**: Clear API contracts and mock services
- **Fallback**: Adjust scope and priorities based on critical path

**Technical Complexity:**
- **Mitigation**: Proof-of-concept development for high-risk features
- **Fallback**: Simplified implementations for MVP, enhanced in future phases
